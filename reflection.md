Use this file to record your reflection on this assignment.

- Which classmates did you consult with while working on this assignment? Eva and Harlow 
- Which session(s) of TA / office hours did you attend? 
- What are your initial impressions of Java? Java feels more strict and structured than Python, which I’m more used to. It was a bit hard at first because you have to follow exact rules and say what type of data you’re using. But I like how neat and organized the code looks. It helps you build good habits when coding.
- Can you draw any conclusion about programming in general from the similarities or the differences between the two languages? Most programming languages have similar basic ideas, like using variables, loops, and if-statements. However, Java needs more setup, like writing classes and method names, while Python lets you start more quickly. Still, both need careful thinking and a lot of time to rethink and rewrite the code.
- What worked, what didn't, what advice would you give someone taking this course in the future?
What worked: Breaking the problem into small parts helped me stay organized. 
What didn’t work: Trying to write the whole logic at once made things messier. I had to rewrite and simplify. Also, anxiety with other classes didnt help to stay on top of things. So, time-management is out the window, unfortunately. 
Advice: Start early (dont procrastinate), ask classmates/friends for help, and don’t be afraid to break your program and test small chunks at a time. Java looks intimidating(for me at least it did), but it becomes more manageable with practice.
